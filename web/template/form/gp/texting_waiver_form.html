                  <p>
                  Text messaging communications (texting) has become a very popular means of communicating.  However, it is not 
                  a secure, or private, way of communicating.  When a person sends a text there is no guarantee that the intended 
                  person will actually receive that text.  The text may not go to the right phone, or the intended phone may be 
                  in the possession of someone other than the owner.  There could be a mistake in the number that was punched in, 
                  or someone could actually have hacked into the phone.  Texting is just not a secure way of communicating - 
                  especially personal information. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  GPS staff will not text any personal health information to your phone.  All GPS staff follow the GPS Privacy Policy 
                  which protects the privacy of your health information. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  By signing below, you have agreed to using "texting as a way of communicating with your GPS Provider."  By agreeing 
                  to do so, you hereby acknowledge and accept the risk of texting protected health information over unsecured media 
                  and devices.  Furthermore, by using texting you hereby release GPS, it affiliates, and Partners from any and all 
                  liability arising from or related to any such unauthorized access. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Once delivered to your device, text messages are under your control and are fully your responsibility.  Additionally, 
                  by using texting you hereby release GPS, its affiliates, and its Partners from any liability arising from or related 
                  to access to these messages once they have been delivered.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  I have read and fully understand the risk of using texting as part of my communication with my GPS designated worker.  
                  I also agree that the use of texting is not a substitute for my ongoing communication to my GPS worker or any GPS representative.  
                  If I find myself in a crisis situation, I will NOT use texting to contact GPS, my worker, or any affiliate but rather avail 
                  myself of the regular channels of communication between myself and GPS, my worker and any GPS representative. 
                  </p>
