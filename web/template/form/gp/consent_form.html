                  <p>
I consent to treatment at Growing Potential Services: Therapeutic and Behavioral Solutions, PC for myself or for 
the person for whom I am the parent/legally authorized representative. I understand that GPS services are provided 
by a variety of mental health professionals. (GPS services may also be provided by a "professional-in-training". 
All professionals-in-training are supervised by a licensed or certified professional.). Psychotherapy and counseling 
may cause thoughts, feelings, behaviors or memories to surface which may be uncomfortable or even painful. I acknowledge 
that no guarantee has been made to me concerning the effect of treatment. My signature below indicates that I have 
reviewed and understand the Consent for Treatment Services and that I consent to treatment.

                  <h4>Client Responsibility</h4>
                  <p>
I understand that I am responsible for ensuring there is transportation for my child to and from appointments. 
I understand that if my child is under the age of 13, I am responsible for staying in the waiting room until 
therapy has concluded. If my child is over the age of 13, I understand that I am responsible for staying in 
the waiting room until my child is called for their appointment. If I choose to leave, I understand I am 
responsible for arriving back to the office at least 15 minutes prior to the end of session. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
I understand that it is my responsibility to carefully read the section in my insurance coverage booklet that 
describes mental health services and to determine exactly what mental health or assessment services my insurance 
policy covers and any limitations involved and if I have questions about the coverage, I understand that I should 
contact my plan administrator.
                  </p>
                  <p>
I understand that it is my responsibility to provide Growing Potential Services: Therapeutic and Behavioral Solutions, 
PC, (GPS) with complete and accurate insurance information.  To best serve me and my health needs, I must always provide 
a current copy of my insurance card to GPS for their files.
                  </p>
                  <p>
I understand that in order for GPS to set realistic treatment goals and priorities, it is important that they have current 
insurance information to evaluate what resources I have available to pay for my treatment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
I understand that GPS will make a best effort to inform me of the anticipated fees involved as soon as this can be reasonably determined. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
I understand that GPS will assist me in filing an insurance claim by filling out forms and submitting claims.  It is 
also important for me to remember that health insurance coverage varies and not all services are covered.  However, 
since plans vary greatly even within a single insurance company, I must understand that GPS can not guarantee my 
coverage and that I am ultimately responsible for payment of services rendered regardless of any verbal communications 
I receive from GPS personnel or my insurance company in efforts to assist you.

In consideration of the services rendered and to be rendered to the above named patient by GPS, I expressly 
understand that I (not my insurance company) am responsible for full payment of GPS fees, co-payments, 
deductibles, non-covered services or services which my insurance carrier may determine to be "not medically 
necessary" or beyond what they determine to be their maximum allowable charges and as such guarantee payment 
of the account and agree to pay any charges left unpaid in whole or in part.  I have received a copy of the 
fee structure for GPS services.  A sliding fee schedule is available upon request and review of financial information.

I understand that all staff of Growing Potential Services are mandated reporters and will follow the Connecticut State Statute 
regarding Mandated Reporting.
                  </p>
                  <p>
Mandated reporters are required to report or cause a report to be made when, in the ordinary course of their employment or 
profession, they have reasonable cause to suspect or believe that a child under the age of 18 has been abused, neglected or 
is placed in imminent risk of serious harm. (Connecticut General Statutes ยง17a-101a)
                  </p>
                  <p>
Child abuse occurs where a child has had physical injury inflicted upon him or her other than by accidental means, has 
injuries at variance with history given of them, or is in a condition resulting in maltreatment, such as, but not limited to, 
malnutrition, sexual molestation or exploitation, deprivation of necessities, emotional maltreatment or cruel punishment. 
(Connecticut General Statutes ยง46b-120)
                  </p>
                  <p>
Child neglect occurs where a child has been abandoned, is being denied proper care and attention physically, emotionally, or 
morally, or is being permitted to live under conditions, circumstances or associations injurious to his well-being.
